# Market Basket Analysis Project

## üìä Project Overview

This project implements **Market Basket Analysis**, a data mining technique used by large retailers to discover associations between items purchased together. By analyzing transaction patterns, retailers can identify relationships between products that frequently appear in the same shopping basket, enabling better inventory management, product placement, and cross-selling strategies.

## üéØ Objectives

Market Basket Analysis helps answer key business questions:
- Which products are frequently bought together?
- What items should be placed near each other in stores?
- Which products can be cross-promoted to increase sales?
- How can we optimize product bundling strategies?

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Libraries & Tools
```python
import pandas as pd          # Data manipulation and analysis
import numpy as np           # Numerical computations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Data visualization
from IPython.core.interactiveshell import InteractiveShell  # Enhanced output display
```

### Development Environment
- **Language**: Python 3.11.0
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Format**: CSV files
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib

## üìà Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
```python
# Load all datasets
customer = pd.read_csv("data/customer.csv")
product = pd.read_csv("data/product.csv") 
product_class = pd.read_csv("data/product_class.csv")
region = pd.read_csv("data/region.csv")
sales = pd.read_csv("data/sales.csv")
store = pd.read_csv("data/store.csv")
time_by_day = pd.read_csv("data/time_by_day.csv")
```

### 2. Data Understanding
- **Customer Analysis**: Demographics, geographic distribution, purchasing behavior
- **Product Analysis**: Product categories, brands, pricing structures
- **Sales Analysis**: Transaction patterns, seasonal trends, store performance
- **Geographic Analysis**: Regional sales patterns and preferences

### 3. Market Basket Analysis Implementation
The analysis typically involves:
- **Association Rule Mining**: Identify frequently occurring item combinations
- **Support Calculation**: Measure how frequently itemsets appear
- **Confidence Analysis**: Determine the likelihood of purchasing item B given item A
- **Lift Calculation**: Measure the strength of association between items

## üîß Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

### Running the Analysis
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure all CSV files are in the `data/` directory
3. Open `Market+Basket.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all cells to execute the complete analysis
